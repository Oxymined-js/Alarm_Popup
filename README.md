Test the alarm on a small python project where a popup image will appear when the alarm time has turned on make sure you have installed the
- pip install playsound so that when run it will emit a sound that can be customized
- pip install tkinter so that the image can appear when the alarm has sounded
a project that was deliberately created to overcome laziness by presenting a popup that can always appear when you are focused and distracted. 

Ver 0.1 Beta 
- Alarm with popup

In the future there will be additional features and can be run through the app without third party applications
